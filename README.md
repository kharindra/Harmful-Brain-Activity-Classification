# Harmful-Brain-Activity-Classification

### Overview

The goal of this project is to detect and classify seizures and other types of harmful brain activity. 

Here, we plan to develop a model trained on **electroencephalography (EEG) signals** recorded from critically ill hospital patients.

This work will help rapidly improve,

- electroencephalography pattern classification accuracy
- unlocking transformative benefits for neurocritical care
- epilepsy
- drug development

Advancement in this area may allow doctors and brain researchers to detect **seizures** or other **brain damage** to provide faster and more accurate treatments.
